# C# Face Classification

Face recognition is used as an authentication process in various fields and especially in computer security related activities, such as homeland security, building access security,
criminal identification, as well as user identification in small mobile devices. 

The goal of a face recognition system is to have a negligible misclassification rate. Face recognition also plays a significant role in the research field of biometric. 
Biometric technology is used for authentication and it may analyse human behaviour.

This project requires developing an automatic face recognition system. The idea is to develop intelligent software using ‘.Net framework (C#)’ to process the images and recognize 
faces in the images. The images will be divided into training and test data (Image dataset has been provided). 

In practice, the test data will have different images from the training dataset. For example, if there are 10 images of a subject S1, use 5 images for training and the remaining 5 
images for testing. Assuming there is a total of 40 subjects, you will have 40x5 images in the training set and 40x5 images in the test set.
